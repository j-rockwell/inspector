# Inspector
Inspector (a.k.a "Roof Inspector") is a proof of concept tool designed to detect damage on a roof from an overhead satellite image of a building.  
  
This tool does not depend on any large computer vision libraries and instead relies upon image enhancement methods like dilation, erosion and masking.
